## Motion in a central force field

We consider the system
$$
\ddot r = -\frac {\partial U}{\partial x}, \qquad U(|r|)
$$
We know that **Angular Momentum** is conserved, since:
$$
\dot M = \frac d{dt} r \wedge \dot r = \dot r \wedge \dot r + r \wedge \ddot r = 0
$$
in polar coordinates
$$
M = \dot\varphi(t)r^2(t)
$$
The 1d problem is
$$
\ddot x = -\frac {\partial V}{\partial x}, \qquad V(x):= U(x) + \frac {M^2}{2x^2}
$$
