This theorem is a global version of [[Liouville local integrability]] theorem, we require more conditions on the manifold where the integral of motion have fixed values, and conclude a cool reparametrization of the system, usefull for qualitative statements about the system motions.

It turns out that the times the variables $(s,f)$ are obtained by a [[Canonical transformations|canonical transformation]]:
