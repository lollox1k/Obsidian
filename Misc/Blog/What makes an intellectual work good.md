From music, code, art and math, every intellectual work is  a collection of ideas. 

Does it need an hidden deep message? No, very superficial

In music lots of ideas need to fit well togheter.

Aestetics everywhere 

One is too focused on seeming complex and hard instead of meaningfull "Look how clever am I, you don't enjoy this music because you don't understand it"

You don't need a clear intent/goal/message (?)

Work work work! Perfect is the enemy of good.
